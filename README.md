Shared Deposit Ethereum contract

This contract allows people to have a shared deposit that can only be unlocked if all partners involved agree. The reason I created this contract is to avoid situations where one person has the access to a deposit that should be shared. It can be used to store a floor bond once signing the contract.
A first version has been deployed to the Ropsten network under the contract address:
0x2A3cCA670A4ba9F5CB76C28dca1ea847d0505a59

The future improvements to be done are:
    • Allow more people to participate in the deposit
    • Allow other tokens to be stored in the deposit (such as USDC)
    • Allow other participants to add more money to the deposit
    • Create a graphic interface to access the contract.
